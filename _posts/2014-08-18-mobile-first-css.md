What is mobile-first CSS?

Mobile-first CSS has pretty much nothing to do with mobile-first design or development practices. They can be related, but don't have to be.

Mobile-first CSS has to do with how you architect your code and media queries, as well as how browsers parse your CSS.

I often times step into codebases that have max-width media queries that target mobile devices. Something to the tune of:

<pre class="phm pbm pbl-ns phl-ns"><code class="f5 f4-ns">
.post-title {
  font-size: 48px;
}

@media (max-width: 320px) {
  .post-title {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
}
</code></pre>

When I first started using media queries - this was a constant pattern in my code. I was used to writing desktop styles
first and I loved the convenience of being able to 'fix' my desktop design for mobile.

Something didn't feel right though. And I started to wonder.
Is this pattern really an anti-pattern?

In Harry Roberts' wonderfully written ['code smells in css'](http://csswizardry.com/2012/11/code-smells-in-css/)
there is a great line that helped shape the way I think about authoring CSS:

<blockquote class="f2 f1-ns bl b--near-white pll mln lh-copy">
  Rulesets should only ever inherit and add to previous ones, never undo.
  <a class="db f5 mtm" href="http://csswizardry.com/2012/11/code-smells-in-css">- Harry Roberts</a>
</blockquote>

When applying this thinking to how we architect our media queries, we could say a device shouldn't parse multiple definitions of the same ruleset if it doesn't have to.

When a devices web browser parses your CSS, it doesn't parse the code within media queries that don't apply to it.

I.E devices that have a screen-width smaller than 64em will not parse anything inside this block:

<pre class="phm pbm pbl-ns phl-ns">
<code class="f5 f4-ns">
@media (min-width: 64em) {
   /* Some CSS here */
}
</code></pre>

In other words **all CSS that isn't inside a media query will get parsed by
your mobile-devices no-matter what**. So you should use that to target the
smallest devices with your default styles and override from there as your
content demands it.

Anecdotally since I started developing my CSS mobile-first, I build
fully responsive interfaces much more quickly as opposed to when I start at large
screen-sizes and work backwards from there. I find that I don't have to 'fix'
my desktop view as my mobile-first CSS works as a desktop interface. I do override my mobile
styles to enhance a design at larger screensizes...but I never feel like I'm fixing broken things.
This was a big shift in my mental approach for authoring CSS.

Another by-product of making the switch to mobile-first CSS, was lighter-weight CSS files.
Personally I think smaller files are rad because there is less to read and the less you have to read the more time you have to look at cat gifs.
