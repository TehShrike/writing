    "Just as in nature systems of order govern the growth and structure of animate
    and inanimate matter, so human activity iteslf has, since the earliest time,
    been distinguished by the quest for order. Even the most ancient peoples
    created ornamnets with mathematical forms of great beauty.
    The desire to bring order to the bewildering confusion of appearances reflects

    "IMMACULATE typography is certainly the most brittle of all the arts. To create
    a whole from many petrified, disconnected and given parts, to make this whole
    appear alive and of a piece — only sculpture in stone approaches the unyielding
    stiffness of perfect typography. For most people, even impeccable typography
    does not hold any particular aesthetic appeal. In its inaccessibility, it
    resembles great
    music. Under the best of circumstances, it is gratefully , accepted. To remain
    nameless and without specific appreciation, yet to have been of service to a
    valuable work and to the small number of visually sensitive readers — this, as
    a rule, is the only compensation for the long, and indeed neverending,
    indenture of the typographer."

<h2>Form &amp; Variance</h2>
<p>
  The web is fluid. This should be considered when designing screens that are
  to be rendered by browsers. Last month people visited bluebottlecoffee.com using
  1,222 different screen sizes.  Building sites that are responsive is only one
  of the design considerations this introduces.  How do you build an interface
  that is well balanced across all screen sizes? How do you build these
  interfaces quickly? How do you build them to be readable? How to do you build
  them to be performant? How do you account for the unknown?
</p>

<h2>Accounting for the Unknown</h2>
<P>
Besides designing for an every growing number of screensizes and resolutions we
must also account for the settings a user picks for their browser. One of these
settings is the base font-size. While this can't be detected with site analytics, it is
estimated from user research studies that 10-12% of people set their default
font-size to something other than 16px. So how do we build designs that scale
proportionally and relatively for the myriad of combinations between devices and
font-sizes that people choose to view the web on? How do we design components
and interfaces to be harmonious with each other in the faces of so many unknowns?
</p>

<h2>Proportions</h2>
<p>
Using relative sizing units - we can ensure that measurements will remain
proportional no matter what font-size a user has chosen. An explicit pixel
value however - will not scale relative to a users settings. This leads to
designs that may be responsive - but do not posess the desired visual harmony.
Static comps with explicit pixel values are not reflective of
the raw materials that make up the web.
</p>

<h2>Alignment</h2>
<p>
  The reality of front-end development is that many people of varying skill
  levels will inherently touch your front-end code. This is not a bad thing - but
  it is a problem that requires design solutions. You must have a system in place
  that makes it easy for people to build well balanced interfaces with as little
  difficulty as possible. Not everyone will care about the quality of code, or
  how it renders to the browser. Not everyone will test the interface on a wide
  variety of devices with various font-size settings. I have yet to see this
  reality be avoided. I have seen many attempts at fixing this problem though.
  The best solution I have seen so far is to use a defined system for people to
  work within - that doesn't make them think. The result of this is that
  regardless on the interface you are working on - your components will all have
  the same sets of relative proportions and things will just magically line up
  without time lost to debugging or re-inventing the wheel.
</p>

<h2>It's just text</h2>
<p>
  The web, is mostly text. People have been studying
  typography for centuries and we would be smart to leverage the findings of
  brilliant designers dedicated to this craft. Regardless of the medium - most
  great design is mathematically based. When designing around text, modular
  scales and attention to proportion is considered to be the start of a sound
  approach. Consider this exerpt from Tschichold's "Form of the Book":
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  The geometrically definable irrational page proportions like 1:1.618 (Golden
  Section), 1: V^2, 1: V^3, 1: V^5, 1:1.538, and the simple rational
  proportions of 1:2, 2:3,
  5:8 and 5:9 I call clear, intentional and definite. All others are unclear and
  accidental ratios. The difference between a clear and an unclear ratio, though
  frequently slight, is noticeable.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  While all of these scales would be a good starting point to use for creating a beautiful
  and harmonious design - all but one lead to sequences of non integer numbers. The 1:2 scale (powers
  of two) leads to a series of integers that browsers don't have difficulty
  rendering. While computers were largely invented to compute mathematical
  problems, browsers are notoriously horrible at math. They compute simple arithmetic equations
  and render values inconsistently. To avoid complicated and unsolvable
  debugging sessions where things don't line up - integers are the best route.
</p>
<p>
  These ratios are common patterns that can be seen in print, architecture and
  music so often it is hard to deny them as an elegant underlying order.
</p>

<p>
  Katsura Villa, a Japanese residence and temple is 'founded on the unit of
  the tatami mat which measures 90:180cm' or a 1:2, powers of two ratio.
  'The aesthetics of this architecture lie in the beauty of its proportions and the materials used.'
</p>

<img src="http://www.archpaper.com/uploads/image/katsura_villa_00.jpg">
<p>
5, 10, 20, 25, 30 etc. cannot be represented by a ratio. They are
ticks on a numberline not seen anywhere else in nature, print, architecture or music when studying cohesive
design systems.
</p>


<h2>Why use 16 as a base?</h2>
<p>
  The default font-size for most browsers is 16px and this is no accident.  This
  is a font-size comporable to type in a book. While printed type is often
  smaller it's partly because books are often times held closer to the face then
  digital screens. While mobile phones and tablets are generally held at the same
  distance as books they are also used while moving more frequently - this
  movement affects the readability of word shapes and so 16px is generally the
  smallest type for content you want to serve up to a user.
</p>
<p>
This is a sample list of graphics display resolutions. You will notice that all
of these numbers are divisible by 16, one exception that is not listed here is
the SXGA+ graphics resolution that is not approved by any organization and was
a break from the mold. It resulted in some weird graphics problems, but that is
a different story for a different time.
</p>
<p>
Granted not all browsers are used at full screen 100% of the time - but it's a
good thing to consider when trying to create proportional designs that scale
well. While we aren't print designers working within a fixed medium - there are
consistencies in almost every graphics resolution which we can use to our
advantage. You will note that these numbers are often not divisible by 5 and only divisible by 10 50% of the time.

  While 5 and 10 are common units because we are (generally) born with ten digits
  on our hands - it seems more suitable to use 16 as a base measurement in this
  medium. Time in music is most commonly divided this way as well. 1/16, 1/8, 1/4
  1/2 and whole notes. These paralells are not a coincidence. Math and music are the
  sisters of design.
</p>

<h2>Inclusive Design</h2>
<p>
  It's easy to fall into the trap of designing for one context. If you have working legs, you
  are not likely to notice that a building has been constructed with a long staircase that is
  not accessible to someone in a wheelchair. If you can't walk up stairs, you definitely notice.
  One of the core values I like to embrace when designing is 'being hospitable.'
</p>
<p>
  What does being hospitable look like on the web?  For me being hospitable means
  not making assumptions about our users and their capabilities.  I have better
  than 20/20 vision. When I first started out as a designer I used a lot of
  small fonts. I thought they looked aesthetically pleasing. I still do think
  that small font sizes often look nice on my shiny hi-def retina screen. I have no
  trouble reading them.
</p>
<p>
  But I'm not designing for myself. I am trying to design for everyone. It should be
  considered that when a 40 year old looks at something only 50% of the light
  enters the retina in relation to a 20 year old. An 80 year old only receives
  20% of the light. This means that text set at lower font-sizes and with lower
  contrasts are impossibly difficult to read for some people.  The age demographics from google
  analytics imply that 40%+ of people that visit our website are above the age of
  35.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Everyone can read large type.</b>  Not everyone can read small type. Much like
  everyone can walk up a ramp, while only some people can walk up stairs. I think
  we should be welcoming to our web guests and cater to their accessibility needs
  because it is the right thing to do. I also think it will make us more money as
  more people can use our site with ease. It is a frustrating experience to
  need to zoom in to read text.
