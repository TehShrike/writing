  I've heard a lot of arguments about why to use webfonts.  In none of those
  arguments, have I heard about a single problem users have that is solved by
  using webfonts. And well, I'm only really interested in solving problems for
  users.
</p>
<p>
  User-testing is an important part of the design process. It allows you to both
  hear what users have to say as well as observe how they use a product. Over the last three
  years I have participated in a number of testing sessions. In that time I:
</p>
<ul class="list mln pln">
  <li>* Never heard a user complain about the use of system fonts in a design.</li>
  <li>* Never heard a user complain about a website having the same typeface as another site.</li>
  <li>* Never heard a user complain about a page using system fonts that loaded too quickly.</li>
  <li>* Never heard a user complain about a site NOT using web fonts.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the flip side I:</p>

<ul class="list mln pln">
  <li>* Observed users abandon a website because the page was loading slowly.</li>
  <li>* Heard people complain about the dreaded flash of unstyled content.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These points were enough to convince me that webfonts cause more problems then
they solve and weren't worth the cost to my users or myself. Webfonts come with
a number of costs. They cost money to license. They cost time to implement.
They cost time to download, and with some mobile data plans they can cost money
to download as well.

Typography is not about aesthetics, it's about serving the text. If even a small percentage of people
don't consume your content due to a use of webfonts, your typography is failing.
</p>

<p>I've completely abandoned my use of webfonts on personal projects.</p>

<p>But even if you do care about aesthetics, I'd like to leave you with two things to consider:<br><br>

  <b>System fonts can be beautiful.</b><br>
  Webfonts are <b>not</b> a requirement for great typography.<br>
