<p>
  One of my best friends is currently taking some classes on design.
  He's an amazing artist and I've always thought he thought like a designer,
  but that's never been his full-time job. So it's been interesting to
  watch him discover things that in someways he's known for years, but maybe
  wasn't able to articulate. I was chatting with him the other day and we had
  this brief exchange that I think perfectly sums up the most important skill of being
  a designer, regardless of the medium. I feel like his words are worth sharing so here they are,
  unedited.

<b>Adam Morse:</b>
  what kind of copy writing are you doing
  that stuff is hard
<b>William Deutsch:</b>
  honestly man
  I have learned more about the creative process in the past 10 months than
  I've learned in my entire life, it's so fucking incredible how this process
  works
<b>Adam Morse:</b>
  what have you learned
<b>William Deutsch:</b>
  to me....I used think that creativity was all about creating awesome answers
  but now I've learned it's all about being an amazing question asker
  which for me is one of my skillsets
  I'm good at breaking down problems
  so its all about starting with a dumb question, answering it and from that
  answer coming to more profound questions with more interesting answers
  thats all very esoteric
  I don't know if it makes sense
<b>Adam Morse:</b>
  no it does
<b>William Deutsch:</b>
  Anyway, to me being creative has two parts: the first is learning to ask a
  compelling question and the second is learning how to give a compelling
  answer. And ultimately it's about being elegant and simple
  A simple answer to a complex question
  Also I've really learned (and I think you're very good at this) how to not
  make things precious

  I think it's obvious from this transcript and that I'm a pretty
  great friend and bring a lot to conversations with friends.
  Also my friend is already discovered the key to being a great designer.
  But honestly, I couldn't have said it better myself.
