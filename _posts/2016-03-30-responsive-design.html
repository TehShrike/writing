<p>Dear people building the internet,</p>
<p>
  Please stop building websites that aren't responsive.
  Please stop assuming that I want to use your site on a desktop.
  Please stop serving up a mobile view that doesn't have the content I want and forcing me
  to try and read your small text on a 'desktop version'.
</p>
<p>
  Please stop breaking the internet.
</p>
