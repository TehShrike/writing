title: "What is CSS for?"

<p>
  HTML is by default: responsive, vector, and highly readable on any device.
  Think about that for a second.
</p>
<p>
  There is an abundance of CSS on the web that constricts these built-in
  features of HTML.  I believe that as CSS authors, we have a responsibility to
  stop this.  If you find yourself writing CSS that removes any of these three
  features, take a minute to stop and rethink its purpose.  Ask yourself what
  problem could be so important that it's worth solving at the cost of
  universal access to your content &amp; readability?

<p>
  CSS is not here to make our lives as developers easy. It's here to enhance the usability of the web for our users.
  <b>CSS should never</b> limit usability.
</p>
<p>
  When we write stylesheets that cascade, we should keep these simple points in mind.
